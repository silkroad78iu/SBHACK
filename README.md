# Intro 

We took this opportunity to integrate the modules that are needed to enable a seamless and more productive future. Our main motivation stems from the understanding that creating enhancing the value of interactions between people, SPs and institutions is at least multip,ed by the number of individuals participate in a society. 
The feasibility of such a seamless future of services from all the verticals of this hackathon and between all the verticals of this hackathon require at its core a powerful, simple and compatible identity solution. Some of the promises of blockchain are turning into realities. Technology is advancing and improving and break necks speed.
Cloud services, mobile applications, verification technologies are reaching a tipping point of invisibility. We believe that all of these technologies are ripe to converge and they will enable such an advanced future such as that is only imagined in hollywood films. 
As Elon Musk has announced robotaxi fleets to be deployed by next year, as genome editing is coming upon us, as civil space access to space, such a future is coming upon us faster than we can all imagine. 
As taxpayers demand more from their contribution, governments are under pressure to reduce friction between parties in order to enhance the underlying economy.

Our solution: 

Our modular combination of the well established (most experienced in the industry) feature-rich AWS Platform together with a dedicated blockchain based identity management system is an easy-to implement, extremely cost-effective, secure, serverless, traceable and simple system

# Next Steps:
